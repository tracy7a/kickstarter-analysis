# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project: 
Help Louise understand how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.

### Purpose
Create visualizations to show campaign outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
I performed the analysis using Kickstarter data by creating pivot tables and pulling together certain
criteria of the data set. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Successful theater outcomes peaked in May. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Outcomes were more succesful with a goal less than 1000.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Challenges were the nummber of columns and rows in data.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
Outcomes based on launch date were successful during the first half of the year, peaked in May, and were less
successful  towards the end of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Outcomes were more successful with a lower goal. Higher goals had a higher chance of failure. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset? 
The line graphs show January-December data for all years of the data set. The result could change if we are 
looking at a specific year.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could create pie graphs to show percentage successful, perctage failed, and percentage canceled.
